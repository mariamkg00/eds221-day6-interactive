## Warmup

```{r}
animal_color <- c("brown bear"," red bird", " yellow duck", "blue horse")
for (i in 1:(length(animal_color) -1)) {
  print(paste(animal_color[i],animal_color[i],"what do you see?","I see a", animal_color[i+1],"looking at me"))
}
```

when to use seq_along or length?

sequence along self produces the range
